# IL2CPP Dumper for Arknights: Endfield & Unity Games

Simple injectable DLL that dumps IL2CPP metadata from Unity games (classes, fields, methods, namespaces, interfaces, etc.).

Originally created for **Arknights: Endfield**.

### Features
- Dumps every assembly from `GameAssembly.dll`
- Two output formats:
  - **Classic C# style** - readable `.cs` files with proper syntax, access modifiers, inheritance & interfaces
  - **AI-friendly** - structured plain text, perfect for LLMs, code generation or parsing
- Activation: press **INSERT** after DLL injection
- Output paths:
  - Normal dumps -> `C:\IL2CPP_Dump_Normal\`
  - AI dumps    -> `C:\IL2CPP_Dump_AI\`
- Log file -> `C:\IL2CPPDump_Log.txt`

### Supported IL2CPP versions
IL2CPP metadata `≈27-29` (Unity 2021.3 - 2023.x - 2024.x builds)

### Example outputs

**Classic C# format** (looks almost like real source code):

**AI-friendly structured format** (easy for AI tools):

### Usage
1. Inject the DLL into the game process (any injector works)
2. Press **INSERT** while in-game
3. Wait for completion (watch the console and log file)

Great for reverse engineering, modding, cheat development or feeding game structure into AI models.
